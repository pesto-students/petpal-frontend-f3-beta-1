## Reflection

This was a 8 week long project built during my Foundation batch-3 at Pesto Tech. Project goals followed development best practices such as PRD, UI/UX design, Development, Dev-Ops,Tech Stack (Express, React, HTML, CSS) and Project Artefacts (PRD,UX Wireframes,Engineering Design Sketch,Frontend,Backend)  

Originally I wanted to build an application that allowed users to add pets , select pets based on category . I started this process by using the `create-react-app` boilerplate, then adding `react-redux @^7.2.6"` and `reduxjs/toolkit @^1.7.1`.  

One of the main challenges We ran into was Authentication, Database design ,Aws image implementation and Add pets form. This lead me to spend a few days on a research spike. Due to project time constraints,

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router, Redux-thunk-saga,react-bootstrap,JSX, and CSS. I chose to use the `create-react-app` boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes. In the next iteration I plan on handrolling a `webpack.config.js` file to more fully understand the build process.
